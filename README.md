# AIMazeSolving

Using various AI techniques to solve mazes. Written in Java because I hate myself :).

## November 2nd

Current abilities:
- Randomly generates a maze depending on difficulty and seed.
  *Note: the seed must be changed in the code for a new maze to be generated. This was done on purpose for later implementations I will be exploring.
- Agent can currently employ Depth-First search to solve both the easy and the hard maze.
- Agent prints out the correct path to the goal state (the red square).
